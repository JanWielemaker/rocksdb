/** <module> RocksDB interface

RocksDB is an embeddable persistent key-value   store  for fast storage.
The store can be used only from one process  at the same time. It may be
used from multiple Prolog  threads  though.   This  library  provides  a
SWI-Prolog binding for RocksDB.  RocksDB   just  associates byte arrays.
This interface defines several mappings   between  Prolog datastructures
and byte arrays that may be configured   to  store both keys and values.
See rocks_open/3 for details.

@see http://rocksdb.org/

%!	rocks_open(+Directory, -RocksDB, +Options) is det.
%
%	Open a RocksDB database in Directory   and  unify RocksDB with a
%	handle to the opened database.  Defined options are:
%
%	  - alias(+Name)
%	  Give the database a name instead of using an anonymous
%	  handle.  A named database is not subject to GC and must
%	  be closed explicitly.
%	  - open(+How)
%	  If How is `once` and an alias is given, a second open simply
%	  returns a handle to the already open database.
%	  - key(+Type)
%	  - value(+Type)
%	  Define the type for the key and value. This must be
%	  consistent over multiple invocations.  Defined types are:
%	    - atom
%	      Accepts an atom or string.  Unifies the result with an
%	      atom.  Data is stored as a UTF-8 string in RocksDB.
%	    - string
%	      Accepts an atom or string.  Unifies the result with a
%	      string.  Data is stored as a UTF-8 string in RocksDB.
%	    - binary
%	      Accepts an atom or string with codes in the range 0..255.
%	      Unifies the result with a string. Data is stored as a
%	      sequence of bytes in RocksDB.
%	    - int32
%	      Maps to a Prolog integer in the range
%	      -2,147,483,648...2,147,483,647.  Stored as a 4 bytes in
%	      native byte order.
%	    - int64
%	      Maps to a Prolog integer in the range
%	      -9223372036854775808..9223372036854775807 Stored as a 8
%	      bytes in native byte order.
%	    - float
%	      Value is mapped to a 32-bit floating point number.
%	    - double
%	      Value is mapped to a 64-bit floating point number (double).
%	    - term
%	      Stores any Prolog term. Stored using PL_record_external().
%	      The PL_record_external() function serializes the internal
%	      structure of a term, including _cycles_, _sharing_ and
%	      _attributes_.  This means that if the key is a term, it
%	      only matches if the the same cycles and sharing is
%	      used. For example, `X = f(a), Key = k(X,X)` is a different
%	      key from `Key = k(f(a),f(a))` and `X = [a|X]` is a
%	      different key from `X = [a,a|X]`. Applications for which
%	      such keys should match must first normalize the key.
%	      Normalization can be based on term_factorized/3 from
%	      library(terms).
%	  In addition, `value` accepts one of list(type) or set(type),
%	  currently only for the numeric types.  This causes
%	  rocks_put/3 and rocks_get/3 to exchange the value as a
%	  list and installs a built-in merge function.
%	  - merge(:Goal)
%	  Define RocksDB value merging.  See rocks_merge/3.
%	  - mode(+Mode)
%	  One of `read_write` (default) or `read_only`.  The latter
%	  uses OpenForReadOnly() to open the database.

rocks_open(Dir, DB, Options0) :-
	meta_options(is_meta, Options0, Options),
	rocks_open_(Dir, DB, Options).

is_meta(merge).


%!	rocks_close(+RocksDB) is det.
%
%	Destroy the RocksDB handle.  Note   that  anonymous  handles are
%	subject to (atom) garbage collection.

%!	rocks_put(+RocksDB, +Key, +Value) is det.
%
%	Add Key-Value to the RocksDB  database.   If  Key  already has a
%	value, the existing value is silently replaced by Value.  If the
%	value type is list(Type) or set(Type), Value must be a list. For
%	set(Type) the list is converted into an ordered set.

%!	rocks_merge(+RocksDB, +Key, +Value) is det.
%
%	Merge Value with the already existing   value  for Key. Requires
%	the option merge(:Merger) or the value type to be one of
%	list(Type) or set(Type) to be used when opening the database.
%	Using rocks_merge/3 rather than rocks_get/2, update and
%	rocks_put/3 makes the operation _atomic_ and reduces disk
%	accesses.
%
%	`Merger` is called as below, where two clauses are required:
%	one with `How` set to `partial` and one with `How` set to
%	`full`.  If `full`, `MergeValue` is a list of values that need
%	to be merged, if `partial`, `MergeValue` is a single value.
%
%	    call(:Merger, +How, +Key, +Value0, +MergeValue, -Value)
%
%	If Key is not in RocksDB, `Value0`  is unified with a value that
%	depends on the value type. If the value   type is an atom, it is
%	unified with the empty atom; if it is `string` or `binary` it is
%	unified with an empty string; if it  is `int32` or `int64` it is
%	unified with the integer 0; and finally if the type is `term` it
%	is unified with the empty list.
%
%	For example, if the value is a set  of Prolog values we open the
%	database with value(term) to allow for Prolog lists as value and
%	we define merge_set/5 as below.
%
%	==
%	merge(partial, _Key, Left, Right, Result) :-
%	    ord_union(Left, Right, Result).
%	merge(full, _Key, Initial, Additions, Result) :-
%	    append([Initial|Additions], List),
%	    sort(List, Result).
%	==
%
%	If the merge callback fails  or   raises  an exception the merge
%	operation fails and the error  is   logged  through  the RocksDB
%	logging facilities. Note that the merge   callback can be called
%	in a different thread or even in   a temporary created thread if
%	RocksDB decides to merge remaining values in the background.
%
%	@error	permission_error(merge, rocksdb RocksDB) if the database
%		was not opened with the merge(Merger) option.
%
%	@see https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/wiki/Merge-Operator for
%	understanding the concept of value merging in RocksDB.

%!	rocks_delete(+RocksDB, +Key) is semidet.
%
%	Delete Key from RocksDB. Fails if Key is not in the database.

%!	rocks_get(+RocksDB, +Key, -Value) is semidet.
%
%	True when Value is the current value associated with Key in
%	RocksDB.  If the value type is list(Type) or set(Type) this
%	returns a Prolog list.

%!	rocks_enum(+RocksDB, -Key, -Value) is nondet.
%
%	True when Value is the current value associated with Key in
%	RocksDB. This enumerates all keys in the database. If the value
%	type is list(Type) or set(Type) Value is a list.

%!	rocks_batch(+RocksDB, +Actions:list) is det.
%
%	Perform  a  batch  of  operations  on  RocksDB  as  an  _atomic_
%	operation. Actions is a list of:
%
%	  - delete(+Key)
%	  As rocks_delete/2.
%	  - put(+Key, +Value)
%	  As rocks_put/3.
%
%	The  following  example  is   translated    from   the   RocksDB
%	documentation:
%
%	==
%	  rocks_get(RocksDB, key1, Value),
%	  rocks_batch(RocksDB,
%		      [ delete(key1),
%		        put(key2, Value)
%		      ])
%	==
